### Changing configuration
- Nginx configurations are used by the nginx pod through configmap - `nginx-server-block`. To make changes you need to update it in `values.yaml` file of this chart otherwise it uses default values.

## Changing static site
- Right now static site has a default html present and this is also a part of configmap, so you can update the `staticSite` section in values file to make new changes.
